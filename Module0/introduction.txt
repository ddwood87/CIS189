My name is Dominic Wood. I work as a Test Engineer at an electrical manufacturer. I'd like to use skills learned in my Computer Information Systems AAS program to develop tools to help with my current job. In the future, I'd like to work full-time as a developer. I have taken Advanced C# and Advanced Java courses, previously. Those languages are very similar, so I'm excited to learn a language with different syntax and concepts. I have noticed that Python is often utilized in machine learning, and I would like to explore that world. I plan to do most of my coursework on the weekends and some weekday evenings. I have read the syllabus and accessed my DMACC email account.
