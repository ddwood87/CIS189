My name is Dominic Wood. I work as a Function Tester at an electrical manufacturer. I'd like to use skills learned in my Computer Information Systems AAS program to develop tools to help with my current job. In the future, I'd like to work full-time as a developer. I took CIS 171 in the Fall 2021 semester under Michael Sgroi. I use Eclipse IDE for my Java coursework on a Windows 10 machine. I plan to do most of my coursework on the weekends and some weekday evenings. I am also taking CIS 332 Database and SQL this semester. I look forward to learning about some higher functionality in Java programming.
